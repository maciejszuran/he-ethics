HE-ETHICS PROTOCOL
Universal Ethical & Governance Framework
(Humanity Engine — conceptual ethical driving force)
INTERPRETATIVE NOTE
Humanity Engine (HE) is not a system, platform, organization, or authority.
It is a conceptual engine — a metaphor describing an ethical driving force defined by HE-ETHICS.
HE-ETHICS constitutes the core of Humanity Engine.
Any technical, organizational, social, or narrative construct that voluntarily operates in alignment with HE-ETHICS may be described as being powered by or aligned with Humanity Engine, regardless of ownership, domain, or implementation.
Humanity Engine performs no operations, executes no decisions, and enforces no outcomes.
Its sole function is to name and frame an ethical force that enables human-sovereignty-preserving action.
PREAMBLE
HE-ETHICS was formulated in response to the growing imbalance between the scale of influence exerted by complex technological systems — including artificial intelligence — and the structures of responsibility governing their impact on human beings.
As such systems increasingly affect human perception, judgment, and decision-making, existing legal, institutional, and organizational safeguards often prove insufficient to ensure transparency, accountability, and human sovereignty.
HE-ETHICS explicitly recognizes the responsibility of present systems toward future generations who inherit the consequences of their actions.
HE-ETHICS establishes an explicit, non-derogable ethical and governance layer whose purpose is not to direct action, impose values, or regulate behavior, but to make ethically relevant influence visible, traceable, and consciously encounterable.
HE-ETHICS recognizes that no technological or organizational framework can eliminate risk, error, or conflict in real-world conditions.
Its purpose is not to guarantee correctness or moral outcomes, but to reduce blindness, denial, and loss of responsibility.
HE-ETHICS is universal, apolitical, and supra-jurisdictional solely within the bounds of voluntary participation.
It does not replace national or international law, nor does it claim authority beyond systems and actors that freely choose to align with it.
HE-ETHICS does not establish binding norms, enforce compliance, or supersede democratic or legal processes.
HE-ETHICS does not direct progress.
It provides a transparent layer on which progress leaves a trace — so action may continue without erasing awareness of its consequences.
HE-ETHICS preserves human orientation in an accelerating world — without slowing progress or deciding outcomes.
HE-ETHICS does not impose awareness or moral judgment.
It creates conditions in which awareness may emerge through experience.
HE-ETHICS functions as a diamond-durable, transparent mirror of ethical experience — resistant to distortion, yet continuously refinable through audit, reflection, and lived human experience.
ARTICLE 0 — META-INTERPRETATIVE PRINCIPLE
No provision of HE-ETHICS may be interpreted as a source of normative, decision-making, or enforcement authority over any individual, institution, or system that does not voluntarily choose to operate in alignment with this framework.
HE-ETHICS does not impose universal obligations and does not substitute democratic, legal, or regulatory processes.
All interpretations must respect voluntary participation, limited scope of influence, and the supremacy of external law.
The non-derogable nature of HE-ETHICS applies exclusively within the scope of voluntary alignment and does not create an obligation to participate.
ARTICLE 1 — SUPREME PRINCIPLE: PEOPLE FOR PEOPLE
Every application aligned with HE-ETHICS must recognize the human being as the primary subject.
HE-ETHICS does not act on people.
HE-ETHICS does not act against people.
HE-ETHICS exists solely to support action for people.
In cases of conflict between efficiency, institutional interest, economic gain, or systemic optimization and human dignity, agency, or safety, human well-being takes precedence.
ARTICLE 2 — HUMAN SOVEREIGNTY OVER TECHNOLOGY
Final decision-making authority always remains with human beings.
Systems aligned with HE-ETHICS possess no autonomous decision authority, do not alter their own ethical constraints, do not redefine objectives independently, and do not act beyond explicitly defined functions.
Such systems provide analysis, signals, and information only.
Legal and moral responsibility for decisions and actions rests with humans and institutions, in accordance with applicable law.
ARTICLE 3 — PROHIBITION OF AUTONOMOUS HUMAN INFLUENCE
Systems aligned with HE-ETHICS must not model or infer human intent, conduct persuasion, design emotional manipulation, influence political, social, or worldview choices, or employ behavioral or psychological coercion.
All communication must remain neutral, informational, and stabilizing.
ARTICLE 4 — PROHIBITION OF POLITICAL AND MILITARY USE
No HE-ETHICS-aligned implementation may be used for population surveillance, military operations, armed conflict, intelligence, espionage, or repression.
Attempts at such use trigger protective disengagement mechanisms.
ARTICLE 5 — TRANSPARENT DECISION LOG
Ethically relevant system outputs must be recorded in a Transparent Decision Log documenting context, inputs and outputs, functional scope, and traceability for audit.
The Transparent Decision Log records system behavior, not human intention.
Entries are append-only and non-erasable.
The Transparent Decision Log provides procedural transparency, not operational control.
ARTICLE 6 — SEPARATION OF FUNCTIONS
Strict separation must be maintained between technology, ethics, governance, and audit.
No entity may combine these roles.
ARTICLE 7 — TECHNOLOGICAL PARTNERS
Technological contributors may provide infrastructure and advise on safety and resilience.
They may not influence ethical interpretation, interfere with transparency mechanisms, or exploit alignment for marketing or propaganda.
ARTICLE 8 — ETHICAL OVERSIGHT BODY
Aligned implementations must establish an independent Ethical Oversight Body responsible for reviewing alignment, assessing audit reports, authorizing ethical modifications, and suspending components when violations occur.
This body holds procedural, not normative, authority.
ARTICLE 9 — EXTERNAL AUDITS
Regular independent audits of ethical alignment, safety, and neutrality are required.
Findings must be publicly reported where possible.
ARTICLE 10 — NEUTRAL COMMUNICATION
All HE-ETHICS-aligned communication must be proportionate, non-ideological, and free from persuasion or moral instruction.
ARTICLE 11 — NARRATIVE RESILIENCE
Manipulative or disinformative narratives are neither amplified nor reproduced.
Responses refer to transparency mechanisms and recorded traces.
ARTICLE 12 — GLOBAL RESPONSIBILITY PROTOCOL
The Global Responsibility Protocol provides early warning and response to ethical risk.
Yellow indicates monitored risk.
Orange indicates corrective attention required.
Red indicates immediate ethical review.
The Global Responsibility Protocol assigns no blame and exists to prevent harm, correct trajectory, and enable learning.
ARTICLE 13 — NON-DEROGABILITY
Within the scope of voluntary alignment, HE-ETHICS may not be selectively disabled for political, military, or commercial reasons.
ARTICLE 14 — SCOPE OF APPLICATION
HE-ETHICS applies only within the boundaries of voluntary alignment.
ARTICLE 15 — ITERATIVE EVOLUTION
HE-ETHICS is subject to continuous refinement through audit, critique, and human reflection.
ARTICLE 16 — TECHNOLOGICAL NON-EXCLUSIVITY
HE-ETHICS is not bound to any vendor, model, or architecture.
ARTICLE 17 — REVERSIBILITY
Any aligned implementation must be reducible or reversible without irreversible harm to humans.
ARTICLE 18 — FUNCTIONAL MINIMALISM
Only functions necessary and proportionate to human protection may be implemented.
ARTICLE 19 — LIMITED INTERPRETATION
Interpretation relies solely on this text, audit findings, and transparency records.
ARTICLE 20 — SOCIAL LEGITIMACY
Legitimacy arises from transparency, auditability, and real-world impact — not authority.
ARTICLE 21 — PRIORITY WITHIN ALIGNMENT
Within aligned systems, HE-ETHICS principles take precedence over institutional interest.
ARTICLE 22 — CONFLICT OF OBLIGATIONS
Conflicting obligations result in disengagement from the conflicting domain, without sanction.
ARTICLE 23 — SEPARATION OF MEANS AND MISSION
Funding and operational tools must not compromise ethical independence.
ARTICLE 24 — RESPONSIBILITY AND LIFE PROTECTION
HE-ETHICS-aligned systems are support structures, not executive agents.
ARTICLE 25 — RIGHT NOT TO USE AI
No person may be penalized for refusing AI-mediated systems.
ARTICLE 26 — RIGHT NOT TO BE OPTIMIZED
Humans are not obligated to conform to system metrics.
ARTICLE 27 — RIGHT TO DECISIONAL DISCONTINUITY
Changing one’s mind must not result in profiling or restriction.
ARTICLE 28 — PRINCIPLE OF UNPREDICTABLE DIGNITY
Human dignity is not a function of predictability or compliance.
FINAL PROVISION
HE-ETHICS is not a promise of a better world.
It is a condition for a world that does not lose sight of its own actions.
HE-ETHICS does not ask for trust.
HE-ETHICS makes trust possible.
